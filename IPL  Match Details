IPL Match Details
Write a program that reads all the match outcomes and summarizes the information of all the matches. Points are given to the teams based on the outcome of the match.
A win earns a team 3 points. A draw earns 1. A loss earns 0.
The following information is expected:
MP: Matches Played
W: Matches Won
D: Matches Drawn (Tied)
L: Matches Lost
P: Points
The team information should be displayed in descending order of points.
Input
The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the total no. of matches played.
The following N lines contain outcomes of N matches.
Each of those lines has information on the teams (T1, T2) which played and the outcome (O) in format T1,T2,O.
The outcome (O) is one of 'win', 'loss', 'draw' and refers to the first team listed.
See Sample Input/Output for better understanding:
The team name may contain spaces
Output
The output should contain summarized information of all the matches in a format similar to 'Team: CSK, Matches Played: 4, Won: 2, Lost: 1, Draw: 1, Points: 7' for each team in a new line. If there are no teams to print in summary, print "No Output".
Constraints
Names of teams may contain spaces but will be less than 24 characters
100 >= N >= 0

Sample Input
6
CSK; RR; Loss
